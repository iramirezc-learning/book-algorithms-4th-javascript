# How much time do I have spent learning this book?

Reading this book has not been easy! I've tried to keep track of how much time I have invested in each section using the Pomodoro technique.

The time invested in each section takes into account the following activities:

- Reading the lesson.
- Writing diagrams of some sort.
- Writing the implementation code.
- Writing the client code example.
- Writing unit tests.
- Writing documentation.
- Refactoring.
- Manual testing.
- Consulting external sources.
- Solving exercises

> _A note about the exercises. I' have decided not to spend more time on solving all the exercises! It is too much already ðŸ˜¥. For now, I just want to understand the implementation of the most basic algorithms and then, if I have the time, I'll come back and continue solving them._

These are my stats:
