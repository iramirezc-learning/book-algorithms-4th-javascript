### Key Concepts

#### Algorithm

> A finite, deterministic and effective problem-solving method suitable for implementation as a computer program.

#### Primitive Data Types

> A Data Type is a set of values and a set of operations on those values.
>
> Examples of Primitive Data Types:
>
> * integers (`int` with arithmetic operations)
> * real numbers (`double` with arithmetic operations)
> * booleans (`bool` with logical operations)
> * characters (`char` representing Alphanumeric Characters and Symbols)

#### Identifier

> A sequence of letters, digits and symbols that represents the name of something (like a function or variable).

#### Variable

> Names a data-type value using an Identifier.

#### Operator

> Names a data-type operation on its value.

#### Literal

> Source-code representation of a data-type value.

#### Expression

> A literal, a variable or a sequence of operations on literals and/or variables that produces a value.

#### Statements

> A program is a sequence of statements which define the computation by creating and manipulating variables, assigning data-type values to them, and controlling the flow of execution of such operations. Statements are often organized in blocks, sequences of statements withing curly braces.
>
> Examples:
>
> * declarations. Associates a variable name with a type at compile time.
> * assignments. Associates a data-type value with a variable.
> * conditionals. Controls different actions for different inputs.
> * loops. Repetitive computations.
> * calls. Invoking of methods.
> * returns. Retuning from methods.

#### Arrays

> Stores a sequence of values of the same type. _This is not true in non-typed programming languages like JS._ The stored values can be accessed by its index which starts from `0` for the first item.

#### Static Methods

> Allow encapsulation, reuse of code and development of programs as a set of independent modules.

#### Strings

> Sequence of Characters.

#### Input/Output

> Communication with the outside world.

#### Data Abstraction

> Extends encapsulation and reuse to allow defining non-primitive data types, supporting Object-Oriented programming.
